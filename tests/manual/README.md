Manual tests should be avoided whenever possible. Only write them if an automated test is not possible or extremely difficult to create. If a manual test is submitted in a PR, it will be rejected if an automated test was feasible, so best to explore automated approaches first!

Manual tests should have the following format:

# Title

_Description of the creator activity that's being tested_

1. _Every_
2. _Single_
3. _Exact_
4. _Input_
5. _Provided_

_Description of the expected output in response to the output_.
