Problem: People can post things that are inappropriate/violate policies.
Solution: Ban them from publicly publishing after repeated offenses.

What we have: Content Warning

Ideas:
Keep track of the number of content warnings on an account
When passed a certain threshold, ban tag on account (different bans in future)
When an account has the ban tag, restrict public publishing
Unbanning function, if another content warning is banned again (different amount of lengths?)

Question:
Where is the code for the content warnings (if we keep track of this number, we can ban)
Do we need Firebase access to do this
How long for the ban
Code for creator attributes & publishing privileges

Functions:
If banned, take down all previous postings (change visibility)
After n 

Important files:
Moderation.ts - Flags projects
Project.ts - Individual project
CreatorDatabase.ts - Creator attributes
