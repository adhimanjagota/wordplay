## What's the problem?

What are you trying to do? Is there a problem you're encountering or a wish you have that a new feature would address?

## What's the design idea?

How would we address the problem with a new or changed feature? Provide as much detail about the idea as you currently have, but no need to provide an exact design specification if you don't have one.

## Who benefits?

Is this something you think only you would benefit from? Are there others that would benefit? Are there others that might be harmed by supporting this?

## Design specification

(This section should be included after a design proposal is ready and approved, and the `buildable` tag is added. This text can remain until then. Designers should add their proposal here, not in a comment).
